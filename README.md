# Low poly water for Unity written with shaders to simulate the water using the linear wave equations and the shallow water equations. #
To come:  
- [x] implementing Shallow Water Equations instead of current version  
- [x] improving shading  
- [ ] add shadows    
- [ ] allow arbitrary large water mesh (currently clamped at 254 x 254)  
- [ ] apply shader to any mesh  
- [x] interactive water (additional script required)
